// Package deadlock holds the result types and error surface of the v1
// non-empty drain deadlock probe. It depends only on topology/model and the
// machine package so that it cannot import the parent topology package. The
// planner-coupled probe entry point (analyzeV1Deadlock) remains in the parent
// package because it needs the live snapshot, budget and planner relation
// helpers; this package owns the immutable outcome that crosses back into the
// parent package and its callers.
