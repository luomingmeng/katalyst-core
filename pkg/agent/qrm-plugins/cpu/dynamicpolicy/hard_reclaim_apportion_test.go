// TestApportionReclaimedPoolKeepsReclaimResidualCoreAligned pins the physical
// core isolation invariant on the reclaim-disabled apportion path. When
// reclaim is disabled we lend reclaimed cpus to the non-binding share pool, and
// the leftover reclaim residual must stay core-aligned so the primary and
// reclaim domains never share a physical core.
//
// Topology: 16 cpus / 2 sockets / 2 NUMAs, CPUsPerCore()==2.
//   NUMA0 cores {0,1,2,3} -> cpus {0,1,2,3} + siblings {8,9,10,11}
//   NUMA1 cores {4,5,6,7} -> cpus {4,5,6,7} + siblings {12,13,14,15}
//
// reclaimedCPUs holds three whole cores per NUMA (12 cpus, fully core-aligned),
// reservedReclaimedCPUsSize keeps a 2-cpu floor, so the share pool is lent
// 10 cpus. TakeHTByNUMABalance grabs cpus one-at-a-time round-robin across the
// two NUMAs, i.e. 5 cpus per NUMA — an odd per-NUMA amount that slices a
// physical core in half. The residual reclaim set is then {11,15}, two lone SMT
// siblings whose partners were lent away, violating core alignment.
//
// This test is RED against the current TakeHTByNUMABalance-based apportion: it
// documents the defect that reclaim residual can hold partial cores. It turns
// GREEN once apportion lends whole cores (core-aligned take) so the residual is
// always core-aligned.
