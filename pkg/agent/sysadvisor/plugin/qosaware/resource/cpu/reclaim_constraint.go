// Package cpu owns the per-scope reclaim ceiling state machine that slowly
// converges the shared reclaim pool toward the ramp-up target (and back)
// without ever yanking it in a single cycle.
//
// # Four quantities (contract)
//
// A reclaim scope (one non-binding NUMA, the global aggregate, or an exclusive
// dedicated region) carries four distinct quantities. They must never be
// conflated:
//
//   - floor       the pure steady reservation lower bound. The pool is never
//     allowed below it; it is the NumaMinReclaimedResourceForAllocate
//     reserve. It is NEVER raised by ramp-up.
//   - desired     the ramp-up midpoint the ceiling converges toward while the
//     scope is active. After ramp-up exits it reverts to steadyCap.
//   - ceiling     the OPTIONAL, rate-limited upper bound the guard publishes to
//     the assembler. nil means "unconstrained": the pool keeps its
//     steady size and must not be floored to an arbitrary value.
//     The ceiling moves by at most one whole-core step per cycle and
//     only after QRM acknowledges the previously published value.
//   - steadyCap   the pool upper bound when no ramp-up is active (the MaxRatio
//     cap). After ramp-up exits the ceiling steps back up to it.
//
// Invariant: floor <= pool <= steadyCap; desired lives in [floor, steadyCap].
// MaxRatio only ever caps; it never raises the floor.
//
// # ACK protocol
//
// The guard does not trust that QRM applied the published ceiling. It compares
// the observed pool size against the last published value:
//
//   - exact equality       is a precise ACK: the ceiling may advance one step.
//   - within cpusPerCore    for quasiAckGraceCycles consecutive cycles is a
//     tolerant (quasi) ACK: QRM is close enough that the
//     pool is effectively tracking; the ceiling may then
//     advance. A larger deviation resets the grace window
//     rather than accumulating it.
//   - anything else         the ceiling is held frozen and the stall counter is
//     incremented.
//
// There is deliberately NO wall-clock timeout on the ACK. A missing/late ACK is
// fail-closed: the ceiling stays frozen (the pool keeps its last published
// size) rather than being advanced on a hunch and risking an over-shrink. The
// only escape is an exact or tolerated observation, which is exactly the
// back-pressure we want when QRM cannot keep up.
//
// # Decision vs commit
//
// constraint()/decideCeiling() are pure: they read the retained state and
// return this cycle's ceilings together with the ACK bookkeeping (whether the
// cycle acked, the proposed quasi-grace counter, and the stall increment). They
// never mutate g.scopeState. commit() is the single writer: it applies that
// bookkeeping and the freshly published ceilings, and reconciles which scopes
// survive. A cycle that fails before commit() (e.g. an isolation safety-check
// rollback) leaves no state behind, so a failed cycle can never half-advance
// the ceiling or corrupt the ACK baseline.
